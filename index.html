        <p>I'm Sarah Toronto! I love to draw digitally and traditionally (pencil/paper) and digitally. I've been liking coding for these past few months, too. I apologise for not having access to a proper smiling picture, I was not photo ready. I will change it when the power is back and my computer has access to better images. I also have drawings of myself, but I was unsure if that was appropriate.</p>
