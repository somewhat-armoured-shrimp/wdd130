            <p>I'm Sarah Toronto! I love to draw digitally and traditionally (pencil/paper) and digitally. I've been liking coding for these past few months as a CS student, too. I'm not sorry anymore -- I look good in that picture.
                I'm adding more information because otherwise it's going to look really bad. I like doing other things too, like video games, usually just single-player games that are simple and fun to play or ones that make the player feel really cool when they get good at them.
                Anyway, I didn't know this was a homepage of sorts until less than a week ago when we got started on the rafting site. Rest in peace laughing out loud.

            <p>With its borders of Canada and the Pacific Ocean, Washington is the pinnacle of Pacific Northwest. Trees, mountains, and water are not in low supply. It's called the evergreen state for a reason. However, that doesn't keep it from also having vast deserts that are just... empty, man. Don't go to those areas if you're like me and you like trees.</p>
