                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In 1884, one man had a dream, a passion for adventure, and skin. That man was Grebert Woody Fitzgerald XXVIII -- our very own, Skelly Tonne. His head made concerning contact with the floor once as an infant, and the effects still remained throughout his life, even after death, which is when he renamed himself. 
                    But that injury did not deter him from pursuing his passion for exploring the great, rushing waters of Texas rivers. However, Grebert also had a deep interest in the dark sciences that many would call evil magic. He created medicines and elixirs and eventually concocted a drink that would make him live forever.
                    By 1990, his old age had finally caught up to him, and he wants others to find that same joy that he experienced exploring rivers. In the 34 years running this business, Skelly Tonne's Whitewater Adventures has helped over 80,020 groups venture down the very rivers Skelly Tonne adored.
